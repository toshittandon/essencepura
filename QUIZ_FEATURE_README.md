## Quiz Logic & Product Mapping

### Question Flow
1. **Skin Type**: How skin feels at end of day (Oily/Dry/Combination/Normal/Sensitive)
2. **Primary Skin Concern**: Main issue to address (Brightening/Anti-Wrinkle/Hydration/Detox/Eye)
3. **Secondary Skin Concern**: Optional additional concern
4. **Sunscreen Preference**: Physical vs. chemical protection
5. **Scalp Concern**: Hair fall, dryness, oiliness, or balanced
6. **Hair Concern**: Damage, dryness, shine, or strength
7. **Body Skin Type**: Sensitive, bumpy, very dry, or normal

### Recommendation Algorithm
The system uses a sophisticated mapping algorithm that considers:
- **Primary mappings**: Direct answer-to-product relationships
- **Combination logic**: Multiple factors for complex recommendations
- **Fallback options**: Default products when specific matches aren't found
- **Routine organization**: Products sorted by usage time (AM/PM/Weekly)

### Product Categories Covered
- **Skincare**: Cleansers, serums, moisturizers, sunscreens, eye care, masks, exfoliants
- **Haircare**: Shampoos, conditioners, masks, scalp treatments, leave-in products
