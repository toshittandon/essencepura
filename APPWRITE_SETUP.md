isAdmin(user) {
  const adminEmails = [
    'admin@terrabotanica.com',

isAdmin(user) {
  return user && user.labels && user.labels.includes('admin');
}
```

### 7. Seed Initial Products (Optional)

You can use the Admin dashboard to add products, or create a seed script:

```javascript
// Example product data
const sampleProducts = [
  {
    name: "Gentle Cleansing Oil",
    description: "A luxurious blend of organic plant oils that gently removes makeup and impurities while nourishing your skin.",
    price: 48,
    originalPrice: 55,
    category: "Cleansers",
    stock: 25,
    ingredients: ["Jojoba Oil", "Rosehip Oil", "Chamomile Extract", "Vitamin E"],
    benefits: ["Deep cleansing", "Hydrating", "Anti-inflammatory"],
    isBestseller: true,
    isNew: false
  }
  // Add more products...
];
```
